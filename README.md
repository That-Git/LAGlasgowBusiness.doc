# Business Management – Business in Action
## <ins>What is a business?</ins>
A business is a particular type of organisation – one which involves people and resources in the making of a good or the providing of a service. All businesses have a name, a set of aims they wish to achieve, an image, resources and rules.
### <ins>Task 1</ins>
Use the Internet to find out the aims of the following businesses. Record your answers in the table below.

| Name of Business | Aims |
| ---------------- | ---- |
| Tesco            |      |
| Primark          |      |
| McDonalds        |      |

## <ins>Needs and Wants</ins>
We buy the goods and services provided by a range of businesses – we are called consumers. We buy these goods and services to satisfy needs and wants.
#### To survive we all have basic needs. These include:
+ Food/Water
+ Clothing
+ Shelter

Once these needs have been satisfied individuals always look for and want more in order to make their lives more comfortable and enjoyable. For example we do not NEED a new iPad to survive, we just WANT it. Perhaps we have seen it advertised on TV or a friend has one and so we would want one also.
- Holidays
- Cars
- Ipad
### <ins>Task 2</ins>
Using the table below identify whether the item in column A could be considered to be a NEED or a WANT

| Life saving medicine |              |
| Jewellery            |              |

Businesses exist to look after or satisfy these NEEDS and WANTS. They make <ins>goods</ins> such as food products, shoes, clothes and electrical goods. Some businesses exist to provide <ins>services</ins> like transport, hairdressing, banking, fast-food take-away and holidays.

### <ins>Task 3</ins>
Using the table below, name a business that you use or know of who provides the following goods and services

| Good or Service     | Name of a Business Organisation                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Holidays            | Thomas Cook                                            |
| Fast food take-away |                                                        |
| Banking             |                                                        |
| Shoes               |                                                        |
| Clothes             |                                                        |
| Hairdressers        |                                                        |
| Television sets     |                                                        |
| Football matches    | (I wonder which type of football they are refering to) |

Goods are <ins>tangible</ins>, which means they can be seen and physically touched. Services are <ins>intangible</ins>, which means that they cannot be seen or physically touched
Goods and services can be <ins>durable</ins> (long-lasting) or <ins>non-durable</ins> (used up quickly). A cinema is an example of a non-durable service – it provides entertainment in the form of a film for about 2-3 hours on average. After that, the service is no longer available. A television set is an example of a durable good – it should last for a few years, at least.
### <ins>Task 4</ins>

## <ins>Business Resource (Factors of Production)</ins>
In order to make a good or provide a service a number of ingredients/resources are required, eg, Land, Labour, Capital and Enterprise. These are also referred to as the FACTORS OF PRODUCTION.
### FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
[<page 7>](https://github.com/That-Git/LAGlasgowBusiness.doc/issues/2)
### <ins>Task 7</ins>

If you were to make a list of the resources (ingredients) which are required to build a house, your list might include:
* Wood
* Joiners
* Ladders
* Slates
* Plot of land
* Bricks
* Electricians
* Plastic
* Building Company
* Drill (Frack Frack Frack!)
* Paint
* Cement mixers
* Glass
* Nails
* Brick Layers

Complete the table below by placing each resource under the appropriate heading.

| Land | Labour | Capital | Enterprise |
| ---- | ------ | ------- | ---------- |
|      |        |         |            |
|      |        |         |            |
|      |        |         |            |

|      |        |         |            |

## <ins>Sectors of Industry</ins>
Businesses exist to produce different goods and services and as such exist in different sectors of industry. There are 3 main sectors as shown in the diagram below.
* PRIMARY
* SECONDARY
* TERTIARY
1. Businesses which exist in the <ins>primary</ins> sector of industry are those that are concerned with using natural resources such as farming, oil drilling, mining, fishing, and forestry. In other words these businesses are concerned with growing products or extracting resources from the ground.
2. Businesses which exist in the <ins>secondary</ins> or manufacturing sector of industry are concerned with the making of products. Manufacturing businesses can take the raw materials from other industries in the primary sector and convert them into different products. For example kellogg’s will purchase crops from farmers to manufacture breakfast cereal.
3. Businesses which exist in the <ins>tertiary</ins> sector do not produce a product. They are concerned with providing services like banking, tourism, beauticians, hairdressers, fitness centres and entertainment like film and TV.

| SECONDARY SECTOR↓                                               | TERTIARY SECTOR↑                                                 |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------: |
| This sector has declined in the UK.                             | This sector has increased in the UK.                             |
| Today there are fewer firms who actually manufacture a product. | Today there are more businesses that actually provide a service. |

## <ins>Task 8</ins>
Decide which sector each of the following areas of business should be included – primary, secondary or tertiary.

The first two have been completed for you

### <ins>Enterprise and Entrepreneurs</ins>
#### <ins>Definition</ins>
An entrepreneur is an individual who develops a business idea and combines the factors of production – land, labour and capital – in order to produce a good or provide a service usually with a view to earning profit.


An entrepreneur is someone who has a good BUSINESS idea and is prepared to take the risk of investing their money to develop the idea.

Most entrepreneurs start as a small business and are responsible for all aspects of managing it. However, as the business grows, the role of the entrepreneur may alter as he/she will then have to employ workers and managers and delegate work for them to carry out.

### <ins>Task 10</ins>
Use the Internet and find out what products or services the following entrepreneurs have had success with.

| Entrepreneur     | Product/Service |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Anita Roddick    |                 |
| Alan Sugar       |                 |
| Richard Branson  |                 |
| Tom Farmer       |                 |
| Duncan Bannatyne |                 |
| Michelle Mone    |                 |

## <ins>Entrepreneurship</ins>
### <ins>Skills of an Entrepreneur</ins>
#### An entrepreneur must:
* take risks – seeing a chance – taking it – risking their own money to invest in the idea;
* have good communication skills – enabling them to communicate with employees, suppliers and of course the customers;
* rise to the challenge – doesn’t give up easily – finds solutions to overcome problems;
* have good decision-making skills – deciding which product to produce, best methods of raising finance, what price to charge customers and which staff to hire;
* have good leadership skills – being able to lead and motivate his/her workers to ‘achieve the dream’!
### <ins>Task 11<ins>
[Visit the website](www.topbusinessentrepreneurs.com)

* Select 2 top business entrepreneurs from the list.
* Prepare a short Powerpoint presentation detailing their history and charting their success.
* Present your findings to the class.
### Gaps in the Market
Spotting a gap in the market means that you have come up with an idea for a product or service which is not being offered by another company and is not already available in the market place. It may be developing a hobby they enjoy or using a special skill or talent they have to come up with a new business product.

Spotting a GAP in the market is a classic key success factor in business!

If an entrepreneur moves quickly to get a product on the market before anyone else, then the financial rewards can be great as customers have to buy from you as there are no other products available to them.

The gap in the market might be providing a product or service in a completely different way. LoveFilm rents DVDs, but they captured the market by sending them through the post rather than following the videoshop model, adding convenience and a huge list to choose from. Moonpig did exactly the same with greeting cards.

Businesses use the law to protect their business idea/product/service by registering ownership of the invention and patenting it. They may even sue for damages if others try to copy their work through the Copyright Act or they can register a trademark to make their company stand out from the rest. Nike has trademarked their “swoosh” logo and their “just do it” slogan.

Coca Cola have also patented their product to prevent anyone else using their logo

##### STEPS
1. Entrepreneurs set up in business selling goods and services that consumers need and want.
2. Consumers use their income and go out to the shops and buy goods and services in order to satisfy their needs and wants.
3. The businesses supplying the goods and services begin to earn PROFIT and this means they can pay employees wages and the owners also become wealthy.
4. Consumers now have even more income to spend (from their wages) and so want even more goods and services.
5. Businesses are now required to expand and produce more goods and services for consumers - and so the PROCESS goes on.

### <ins>The Business Plan<ins>
A business plan is a document which outlines the objectives of a business and how it intends to achieve these objectives. These are used mainly when starting out in business. You need to find out if it is financially viable (wise) to actually set the business up in the first place. You will need to work out all your costs and carry out market research on potential customers to find out if sales income will be enough to cover these costs and earn profit.

The entrepreneur can therefore decide whether it is worthwhile going ahead with the business idea or whether the anticipated profit is too low a level to justify financing his/her idea.

It is also likely to be used to convince investors, for example, a Bank Manager to lend the business cash in order to get it started. Banks and other lenders are more likely to lend to entrepreneurs who have been thorough in their planning and research.

<ins>To be convincing, it must therefore contain essential information:</ins>

* <ins>General</ins> details – the name of the business, proposed location and what it is going to produce;
* <ins>The market</ins> – who are the potential customers?
* <ins>Human resources</ins> – who will be employed and work for the business?
* <ins>Finance</ins> – what are the expected costs of running the business, what sales income is expected and what is the expected profit? Also where is the start-up cash coming from, ie, all from the owner/s or partially from a loan?

The Business Plan can also be used when planning for expansion. You may want to redo your business plan with the new costs and benefits – this will help you decide if expansion is the right thing for your business.

### <ins>Task 17<ins>
#### <ins>Case Study – completing a Business Plan</ins>
###### (You may wish to work in pairs to complete this task)

You have decided to open a business - Ground Force - using your skills as a landscape gardener. You have worked with a local firm and have spotted a <ins>*gap in the market*</ins> for a local domestic gardening service.

You will be working from your own home – a room in your house will be converted into an office for the business. You will provide a full garden design service including paving, decking, laying lawns and planting trees and shrubs.

Your market includes retired people and working families who are keen to upgrade their gardens. Most Glasgow based companies specialise in garden maintenance rather than garden design and deal mainly with commercial companies, so there is very little competition. You will initially distribute leaflets around the area to let people know about your business. You also plan to advertise in local shops and newspapers.

You will need to employ 2 other people to work with you – someone who has expertise in building walls and a qualified gardener. You will do all your own paperwork and carry a mobile phone to save the expense of an Administrative Assistant.

You estimate your income to be £45,000. You know this is realistic having worked locally for a landscape company.

Cash flow will be a problem. You are at present trying to negotiate credit terms of 60 days from your suppliers and will only accept cash payments from your customers – you will not offer customers any work on credit. You will pay all bills from the cash you receive. Estimated costs in the first year are £14,000 giving an estimated profit of £31,000.

You are lucky enough to have had a small lottery win and have £8,000 to invest in your business. You will use some of this money to buy the following equipment: spades, rakes, lawnmowers and cement mixers etc.
##### <ins>You should:</ins>
1. Draft your Business Plan on the template provided on the next page.
2. Access your computer and load the electronic template ‘Business Plan’ and complete a final version of your plan.
3. Put your name in the footer and print one copy. Save your work using the filename BP1/own initials.

## <ins>Sources of Finance</ins>
At some point a business may need to borrow money from banks or other investors for purposes such as paying the staff wages, or buying a piece of machinery or for expanding the business.

Businesses can access many different sources of finance. The source of finance used depends on what the finance is for, and how long it is required for
| source | pro | con |
| - | - | - |
| BANK OVERDRAFT | A customer can overdraw from their bank account, ie, spend more than they have in their bank account up to an agreed limit. They could, for example, pay wages from their bank account even though they have no money in their account. | This can work out expensive if used for a long time as interest is charged daily. The facility may be withdrawn immediately if the limit is exceeded. |
TRADE CREDIT | Businesses can buy goods from suppliers and then arrange to pay for them at a later date. This gives the firm time to sell the products at a higher price, earn a profit and then pay their suppliers – hopefully before the bill or invoice arrives. | Sometimes suppliers offer a cash discount (reduction in price) for prompt payment. The firm will lose the cash discount if they take too long to pay. Also suppliers may be reluctant to sell more goods on credit if the business struggles to pay on time. |
FACTORING (DEBT COLLECTOR) | When customers who buy on credit fail to pay on time or attempt not to pay at all the business can use a factoring service. The factor will buy the debts of the business and they will then attempt to recover payment from the customers. This saves the business time pursuing customers and ensures the business receives most of the money it is owed. | The factor charges the business a fee for their service and so this reduces the amount of cash they will actually receive. Factors tend only to be interested in pursuing customers who owe large amounts of money to the business. |
SHORT-TERM BANK LOAN | The bank may provide a loan to the business for a fixed amount to be paid back over a fixed period of time in fixed monthly instalments. The loan may be used to buy an essential piece of equipment or to obtain extra cash to pay bills. Because it is a short- term loan there will be less interest payments. | When the business tends to be small, or newly formed, they tend to be more of a risk. As such these loans can be more difficult to obtain and the interest rate to be paid tends to be much higher. |
HIRE PURCHASE | Higher purchase allows a business to buy an asset such as a delivery van and pay it back over 36 months. A deposit is required followed by payment over a few years. This allows the business to purchase items like machinery and equipment with only a small initial outlay of money. | The business does not legally own the asset (machinery or equipment) until the last payment has been made. Interest is usually charged and so it can be an overall more expensive way of purchasing large items. |
LEASING | When a business uses a leasing system it never owns the asset. The business simply ‘rents’ the asset. For example Arnold Clark now offers a leasing system to allow small businesses to rent motor vehicles and vans. The advantage is that the leasing system will replace the asset every couple of years and they are also responsible for any repairs. | The business will never actually own the asset. Rental charges or leasing costs can build up over a long period of time and so it may actually work out cheaper to actually purchase the asset in the first place. |
ADDITIONAL CAPITAL | This is where the amount of money invested in the business by the owner is increased by the owners (they take more of their own personal savings and ‘lend’ it to the business. Or they may decide to invite a partner to join the business. The business does not need to pay back the money which has been invested and there is no interest to pay or any other costs involved. | The owner/s are now risking more of their own personal money as more of their private savings are ‘tied up’ in the business. If a partner is now involved in running the business, profits now have to be shared and so each owner gets a smaller share of the profits |
MORTGAGE | A common method of financing land and premises such as shops is to take out a mortgage which is a type of long-term loan secured against the title deeds of a property or piece of land. The business is given a long period of time (25 years) to pay the mortgage back. | Interest has to be paid on top of the initial amount borrowed. If the business does not pay the mortgage back or falls drastically behind with repayments, the lender (bank or building society) can claim ownership of the property or land etc.
LONG-TERM BANK LOAN | The bank may grant a loan for a fixed amount, to be paid back over a fixed period of time in fixed instalments. A long-term loan might be taken out to buy a very expensive piece of machinery and be re-paid over a 5 year period. As such the business is able to purchase machinery now and use it in the business to start generating profit. | The business has now incurred debts and must ensure that all monthly payments are made on time. Interest is usually charged on top of the initial loan amount and so this can be a very expensive way of purchasing equipment and machinery. |
GRANT | A Source of finance from central government or local government, Business Gateway or the Princes Trust. In most cases the money does not have to be repaid. | It is usually a one-off payment and certain conditions or criteria must be met before it can be obtained. Usually the business is told what the money must be used for. |
RETAINED PROFITS | A business can use its profits to purchase machinery and equipment. The advantage is that there is no interest to be paid and the business is not incurring any debts. The business will own the assets straight away. | When a business spends all of its profits it can run into cash flow problems. They may not be able to pay for any unexpected costs or expenses as all profit has been spent. |

## SOLE TRADER (not to be confused with soul traders)
A sole trader is a one-owner business (it is owned and controlled by one person). Most small businesses are sole traders, for example, hairdressers or plumbing businesses.

Finance is available from the owner’s own savings, bank loans and government grants.

Sole traders usually aim to survive and maximise profits.
* One person owns and runs the business
* Work may stop or business may close if owner is ill
* Owner is responsible for all business debts (Unlimited Liability)
* Difficult for owner to get time off
* Owner gets to make all the decisions

## FRANCHISE
A franchise is a business agreement where one business can operate under the name of another business. <ins>The franchisee</ins> pays the <ins>franchisor</ins> a percentage of his/her annual sales or profits or agrees to pay a set fee each year. This then allows the franchisee to operate with the business name (which is usually very well known) and sell the products and services associated with the business name.

### <ins>Task 25<ins>
Read the following case study on franchising of the pizza delivery business and then answer the following questions on A4 paper.
#### Delivering Fast Food Franchising
1. Domino’s Pizza leads the UK market for home delivered pizza and is also the world’s largest franchise for this type of distribution.
2. Franchising means selling the rights to use a firm’s logos, operating methods and brand name. Other franchised operations include Pizza Hut Express, Perfect Pizza and its partner brand Papa John’s. There is also a flow of newcomers such as EasyPizza and Telepizza. In a market dominated by franchise operations, why is this type of business organisation so successful for numerous pizza brands? And why is franchising the business organisation of choice for many individuals wanting to start their own business.
###### Franchising or direct control?
3. PizzaExpress restaurants expanded entirely through franchises during the 1970’s and 1980’s but the owner Gondola plc bought back the contracts in the mid 19990’s. Its objective was to give the company greater control over its brand, outlets and reputation. This has been achieved, but the growth in the business has been almost half of that of franchised operations.
4. Investment has not been a problem for the Pizza Hut restaurant chain in the UK, with the massive resources of Whitbread funding its growth. However, the company has decided to use the power of franchising to develop its home delivery brand, Pizza Hut Express, as it has identified more growth in this segment. In fact expansion across the country has been achieved almost entirely through franchising. It is believed that there are as many as 2,000 franchisees awaiting approval to own a Domino’s delivery outlet alone.

5. Despite losing some control over the business franchising is a cost-effective way for an organisation to grow. Most of the set-up costs are paid by the franchisee. Additionally the annual franchise fees go straight to the franchising company’s profits. In the case of Domino’s this helped to boost their profits by 35% in 2006 to £8.8 million.

6. Domino’s believes it can achieve a market penetration of over 1,000 franchised units in Britain. An individual Domino’s outlet can serve up to 20,000 homes and, as the UK has around 25 million households, its projected growth and profits may continue for some time to come. The company intends to open 250 new outlets over the next 5 years. Similarly, Perfect Pizza plans to create more than 2,000 jobs in 100 new franchised takeaways and increase its market share to 15%. The company, which already has 200 outlets, intends to carry out the expansion over the next 5 years in the north of England and Scotland.

###### Advantages of Franchising

7. Despite the costs of buying a franchise and territory, business start-ups based on franchising have a far lower failure rate than independent firms. An entrepreneur needs cash of at least £50,000 to start with will-known franchises such as Domino’s and Pizza Hut Express. The associated risks of such a level of investment – and the need to take out additional loans – are reduced because trading strategies and methods have been tried and tested by these established brands.

8. Many young (consumers) people will not use unknown independent outlets. Names and logos such as Pizza Hut and Dominos have wide customer loyalty, ensuring the franchised outlet has immediate demand. Additionally, large franchise businesses have marketing budgets way beyond other independent sole traders. As an example, Domino’s has bought the right to use The Simpsons in its latest promotional campaign; such an investment would be impossible for an small-scale independent sole trader.

9. Television advertising has played a major part in the success of Pizza Hut. To achieve good national exposure requires an investment of at least £500,000; small independent (sole trader) pizza delivery services could never compete at this level.

10. The potential danger for new franchises is the saturation of the pizza delivery market, over-supplied by competing brands. There are also concerns that the increasing concern about high levels of fat in our diet may eventually affect pizza sales.

## PUBLIC SECTOR
| Central Government | Local Government |
| - | - |
| Westminster Government & Scottish Parliament | Local Councils |

### Central Government
###### The Westminster (Houses of Parliament) and the Scottish Parliament provide important national services such as
- Health
- Transport
- Defence
###### Finance
this comes mainly from taxes paid by the public.
###### Objectives
- provide a high quality and efficient service (eg, National Health Service);
- to improve society;
- to make effective use of taxes.

Central Government is organised and operated by elected politicians. To help achieve its aims and objectives Central government delegates resources and responsibility to Local government.
### Local Government
Local Government (Local councils) are set up by central government (Scottish Parliament) and are run on its behalf by locally elected councillors. The day to day running of services is organised by managers and employees of each council. A local council aims to meet the needs of local people and businesses. Local councils do not aim to make profit – rather they are required to provide the most efficient service possible within allocated budgets.

###### Local government functions include the organisation of:
+ education and leisure services - staffing, buildings, museums, pools and sports centres, childcare, psychological services, halls and community facilities, libraries;
+ social work - community care, children and family services;
+ planning and transport - roads, public transport, economic development, flood prevention, development of new buildings;
+ environmental services - refuse collection and disposal, street lighting, food safety, health promotion, animal welfare, maintenance of parks and cemeteries;
+ housing - allocation and maintenance of public housing, homeless provision, rent collection, building new council houses;
+ finance - annual budgets for managing income and spending, financial reports, collection of Council Tax and business rates;
+ information technology – use of ICT across all council services.

It is clear, therefore, that the work of local government has a huge impact on the lives of residents of the area. However, local governments generally have to act within central government policy even if it is something of which they are not particularly in favour. There is constant monitoring of local government activities in an effort to ensure that 'best value' is always being attained.
###### Finance
Local governments are financed in a variety of ways:
+ government grants - the main source of local government income. This money comes from the UK government via the Scottish Parliament and accounts for about 40% of total council income;
+ council tax - an amount of money paid by each household based on the value of the property. Each local authority sets its own council tax rate;
+ non-domestic rates - paid by businesses. This is set by the central government and is the same across the country charges for services: such as entrance to leisure facilities, housing rents;
+ the sale of assets - such as council houses.
### Public Corporations
These are companies that are owned and controlled by central government. The government appoints a chairperson and board of directors to run the company on the government’s behalf. Examples of Public corporations include the BBC and Royal Mail.
### VOLUNTARY (THIRD) SECTOR
These organisations have different aims from those of private sector enterprises. They are ‘not for profit’ organisations and very often their reason for existing is to help a charitable cause in some way.
#### Charities
The government regulates the activities of charities and keeps a Register of Charities in the UK. Charities are exempt from paying most taxes. Charities are often set up as trusts with no individual owner, and overall management and control is undertaken by unpaid trustees (people who are placed in a position of trust with the responsibility for looking after the interests of others).
###### Finance
* Donations from the public
* Donations from companies
* Government grants
* Lottery Grants
* Profits from charity shops
###### Objectives
* To provide a service
* To relieve poverty
* To fund medical research
* To provide protection to the vulnerable
#### Voluntary Organisations
Voluntary organisations are run and staffed by volunteers. Examples include the Scouts, youth clubs, Brownies, sports clubs. They bring together people with similar interests. They are run by a committee of elected volunteers.

These organisations can raise finance by applying for grants from the lottery, Sports Council or local authorities. They may also charge a fee to become a member of their organisation or to use their facilities.
