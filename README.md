# Business Management – Business in Action
## <ins>What is a business?</ins>
A business is a particular type of organisation – one which involves people and resources in the making of a good or the providing of a service. All businesses have a name, a set of aims they wish to achieve, an image, resources and rules.
## <ins>Task 1</ins>
Use the Internet to find out the aims of the following businesses. Record your answers in the table below.

| Name of Business | Aims |
| ---------------- | ---- |
| Tesco            |      |
| Primark          |      |
| McDonalds        |      |

## <ins>Needs and Wants</ins>
We buy the goods and services provided by a range of businesses – we are called consumers. We buy these goods and services to satisfy needs and wants.
### To survive we all have basic needs. These include:
+ Food/Water
+ Clothing
+ Shelter

Once these needs have been satisfied individuals always look for and want more in order to make their lives more comfortable and enjoyable. For example we do not NEED a new iPad to survive, we just WANT it. Perhaps we have seen it advertised on TV or a friend has one and so we would want one also.
- Holidays
- Cars
- Ipad
## <ins>Task 2</ins>
Using the table below identify whether the item in column A could be considered to be a NEED or a WANT

| Item                 | Need or Want |
| -------------------- | ------------ |

| Life saving medicine |              |
| Jewellery            |              |

Businesses exist to look after or satisfy these NEEDS and WANTS. They make <ins>goods</ins> such as food products, shoes, clothes and electrical goods. Some businesses exist to provide <ins>services</ins> like transport, hairdressing, banking, fast-food take-away and holidays.

## <ins>Task 3</ins>
Using the table below, name a business that you use or know of who provides the following goods and services

| Good or Service     | Name of a Business Organisation                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Holidays            | Thomas Cook                                            |
| Fast food take-away |                                                        |
| Banking             |                                                        |
| Shoes               |                                                        |
| Clothes             |                                                        |
| Hairdressers        |                                                        |
| Television sets     |                                                        |
| Football matches    | (I wonder which type of football they are refering to) |

Goods are <ins>tangible</ins>, which means they can be seen and physically touched. Services are <ins>intangible</ins>, which means that they cannot be seen or physically touched
Goods and services can be <ins>durable</ins> (long-lasting) or <ins>non-durable</ins> (used up quickly). A cinema is an example of a non-durable service – it provides entertainment in the form of a film for about 2-3 hours on average. After that, the service is no longer available. A television set is an example of a durable good – it should last for a few years, at least.

### <ins>Business Resource (Factors of Production)</ins>
In order to make a good or provide a service a number of ingredients/resources are required, eg, Land, Labour, Capital and Enterprise. These are also referred to as the FACTORS OF PRODUCTION.
## FACTORS OF PRODUCTION

* Plot of land
* Bricks
* Electricians
* Plastic
* Building Company
* Drill (Frack Frack Frack!)

| Land | Labour | Capital | Enterprise |
| ---- | ------ | ------- | ---------- |
|      |        |         |            |
|      |        |         |            |
|      |        |         |            |
|      |        |         |            |
|      |        |         |            |
|      |        |         |            |

### <ins>Sectors of Industry</ins>
Businesses exist to produce different goods and services and as such exist in different sectors of industry. There are 3 main sectors as shown in the diagram below.
* PRIMARY
* SECONDARY
* TERTIARY
1. Businesses which exist in the <ins>primary</ins> sector of industry are those that are concerned with using natural resources such as farming, oil drilling, mining, fishing, and forestry. In other words these businesses are concerned with growing products or extracting resources from the ground.
2. Businesses which exist in the <ins>secondary</ins> or manufacturing sector of industry are concerned with the making of products. Manufacturing businesses can take the raw materials from other industries in the primary sector and convert them into different products. For example kellogg’s will purchase crops from farmers to manufacture breakfast cereal.
3. Businesses which exist in the <ins>tertiary</ins> sector do not produce a product. They are concerned with providing services like banking, tourism, beauticians, hairdressers, fitness centres and entertainment like film and TV.

| SECONDARY SECTOR↓                                               | TERTIARY SECTOR↑                                                 |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------: |
| This sector has declined in the UK.                             | This sector has increased in the UK.                             |
| Today there are fewer firms who actually manufacture a product. | Today there are more businesses that actually provide a service. |

## <ins>Task 7</ins>
Decide which sector each of the following areas of business should be included – primary, secondary or tertiary.

The first one has been completed for you
