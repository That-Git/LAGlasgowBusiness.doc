# Business Management – Business in Action
## <ins>What is a business?</ins>
A business is a particular type of organisation – one which involves people and resources in the making of a good or the providing of a service. All businesses have a name, a set of aims they wish to achieve, an image, resources and rules.
### <ins>Task 1</ins>
Use the Internet to find out the aims of the following businesses. Record your answers in the table below.

| Name of Business | Aims |
| ---------------- | ---- |
| Tesco            |      |
| Primark          |      |
| McDonalds        |      |

## <ins>Needs and Wants</ins>
We buy the goods and services provided by a range of businesses – we are called consumers. We buy these goods and services to satisfy needs and wants.
#### To survive we all have basic needs. These include:
+ Food/Water
+ Clothing
+ Shelter

Once these needs have been satisfied individuals always look for and want more in order to make their lives more comfortable and enjoyable. For example we do not NEED a new iPad to survive, we just WANT it. Perhaps we have seen it advertised on TV or a friend has one and so we would want one also.
- Holidays
- Cars
- Ipad
### <ins>Task 2</ins>
Using the table below identify whether the item in column A could be considered to be a NEED or a WANT

| Life saving medicine |              |
| Jewellery            |              |

Businesses exist to look after or satisfy these NEEDS and WANTS. They make <ins>goods</ins> such as food products, shoes, clothes and electrical goods. Some businesses exist to provide <ins>services</ins> like transport, hairdressing, banking, fast-food take-away and holidays.

### <ins>Task 3</ins>
Using the table below, name a business that you use or know of who provides the following goods and services

| Good or Service     | Name of a Business Organisation                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Holidays            | Thomas Cook                                            |
| Fast food take-away |                                                        |
| Banking             |                                                        |
| Shoes               |                                                        |
| Clothes             |                                                        |
| Hairdressers        |                                                        |
| Television sets     |                                                        |
| Football matches    | (I wonder which type of football they are refering to) |

Goods are <ins>tangible</ins>, which means they can be seen and physically touched. Services are <ins>intangible</ins>, which means that they cannot be seen or physically touched
Goods and services can be <ins>durable</ins> (long-lasting) or <ins>non-durable</ins> (used up quickly). A cinema is an example of a non-durable service – it provides entertainment in the form of a film for about 2-3 hours on average. After that, the service is no longer available. A television set is an example of a durable good – it should last for a few years, at least.
### <ins>Task 4</ins>

## <ins>Business Resource (Factors of Production)</ins>
In order to make a good or provide a service a number of ingredients/resources are required, eg, Land, Labour, Capital and Enterprise. These are also referred to as the FACTORS OF PRODUCTION.
### FACTORS OF PRODUCTION
[<page 7>](https://github.com/That-Git/LAGlasgowBusiness.doc/issues/2)
### <ins>Task 7</ins>

If you were to make a list of the resources (ingredients) which are required to build a house, your list might include:
* Wood
* Joiners
* Ladders
* Slates
* Plot of land
* Bricks
* Electricians
* Plastic
* Building Company
* Drill (Frack Frack Frack!)
* Paint
* Cement mixers
* Glass
* Nails
* Brick Layers

Complete the table below by placing each resource under the appropriate heading.

| Land | Labour | Capital | Enterprise |
| ---- | ------ | ------- | ---------- |
|      |        |         |            |
|      |        |         |            |
|      |        |         |            |

|      |        |         |            |

## <ins>Sectors of Industry</ins>
Businesses exist to produce different goods and services and as such exist in different sectors of industry. There are 3 main sectors as shown in the diagram below.
* PRIMARY
* SECONDARY
* TERTIARY
1. Businesses which exist in the <ins>primary</ins> sector of industry are those that are concerned with using natural resources such as farming, oil drilling, mining, fishing, and forestry. In other words these businesses are concerned with growing products or extracting resources from the ground.
2. Businesses which exist in the <ins>secondary</ins> or manufacturing sector of industry are concerned with the making of products. Manufacturing businesses can take the raw materials from other industries in the primary sector and convert them into different products. For example kellogg’s will purchase crops from farmers to manufacture breakfast cereal.
3. Businesses which exist in the <ins>tertiary</ins> sector do not produce a product. They are concerned with providing services like banking, tourism, beauticians, hairdressers, fitness centres and entertainment like film and TV.

| SECONDARY SECTOR↓                                               | TERTIARY SECTOR↑                                                 |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------: |
| This sector has declined in the UK.                             | This sector has increased in the UK.                             |
| Today there are fewer firms who actually manufacture a product. | Today there are more businesses that actually provide a service. |

## <ins>Task 8</ins>
Decide which sector each of the following areas of business should be included – primary, secondary or tertiary.

The first two have been completed for you

### <ins>Enterprise and Entrepreneurs</ins>
#### <ins>Definition</ins>
An entrepreneur is an individual who develops a business idea and combines the factors of production – land, labour and capital – in order to produce a good or provide a service usually with a view to earning profit.


An entrepreneur is someone who has a good BUSINESS idea and is prepared to take the risk of investing their money to develop the idea.

Most entrepreneurs start as a small business and are responsible for all aspects of managing it. However, as the business grows, the role of the entrepreneur may alter as he/she will then have to employ workers and managers and delegate work for them to carry out.

### <ins>Task 10</ins>
Use the Internet and find out what products or services the following entrepreneurs have had success with.

| Entrepreneur     | Product/Service |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Anita Roddick    |                 |
| Alan Sugar       |                 |
| Richard Branson  |                 |
| Tom Farmer       |                 |
| Duncan Bannatyne |                 |
| Michelle Mone    |                 |

## <ins>Entrepreneurship</ins>
### <ins>Skills of an Entrepreneur</ins>
#### An entrepreneur must:
* take risks – seeing a chance – taking it – risking their own money to invest in the idea;
* have good communication skills – enabling them to communicate with employees, suppliers and of course the customers;
* rise to the challenge – doesn’t give up easily – finds solutions to overcome problems;
* have good decision-making skills – deciding which product to produce, best methods of raising finance, what price to charge customers and which staff to hire;
* have good leadership skills – being able to lead and motivate his/her workers to ‘achieve the dream’!
### <ins>Task 11<ins>
[Visit the website](www.topbusinessentrepreneurs.com)

* Select 2 top business entrepreneurs from the list.
* Prepare a short Powerpoint presentation detailing their history and charting their success.
* Present your findings to the class.
### Gaps in the Market
Spotting a gap in the market means that you have come up with an idea for a product or service which is not being offered by another company and is not already available in the market place. It may be developing a hobby they enjoy or using a special skill or talent they have to come up with a new business product.

Spotting a GAP in the market is a classic key success factor in business!

If an entrepreneur moves quickly to get a product on the market before anyone else, then the financial rewards can be great as customers have to buy from you as there are no other products available to them.

The gap in the market might be providing a product or service in a completely different way. LoveFilm rents DVDs, but they captured the market by sending them through the post rather than following the videoshop model, adding convenience and a huge list to choose from. Moonpig did exactly the same with greeting cards.

Businesses use the law to protect their business idea/product/service by registering ownership of the invention and patenting it. They may even sue for damages if others try to copy their work through the Copyright Act or they can register a trademark to make their company stand out from the rest. Nike has trademarked their “swoosh” logo and their “just do it” slogan.

Coca Cola have also patented their product to prevent anyone else using their logo
