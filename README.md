# Business Management – Business in Action
## <ins>What is a business?</ins>
A business is a particular type of organisation – one which involves people and resources in the making of a good or the providing of a service. All businesses have a name, a set of aims they wish to achieve, an image, resources and rules.

## <ins>Needs and Wants</ins>
We buy the goods and services provided by a range of businesses – we are called consumers. We buy these goods and services to satisfy needs and wants.
### To survive we all have basic needs. These include:
+ Food/Water
+ Clothing
+ Shelter
Once these needs have been satisfied individuals always look for and want more in order to make their lives more comfortable and enjoyable. For example we do not NEED a new iPad to survive, we just WANT it. Perhaps we have seen it advertised on TV or a friend has one and so we would want one also.
- Holidays
- Cars
- Ipad
